	! Removed dependancy on File::Copy inside Cache::Repository::Filesys
          File::Copy::copy cannot handle copying from string GLOBs such that
          C<open my $fh, '<', \$buffer> would give you a filehandle that could
          be used to create a file in the repository.
        ! Cleaned up retrieval code
        + Added dir_mapping to C::R::Filesys

0.03
        + Added checking for retrieval of non-existant tags.
